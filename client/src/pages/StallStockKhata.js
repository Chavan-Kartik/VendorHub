    <p className="text-lg mb-4">
      VendorHub offers a digital ledger (khata) app that evolves into a micro-credit and inventory financing platform. It turns a vendor's daily sales data into a trust score, unlocking access to capital.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-4">
      With VendorHub, vendors can keep track of daily sales and expenses, build a digital transaction history, and become eligible for short-term credit to buy raw materialsâ€”even on tough days. No more worrying about a single day of bad sales disrupting your business!
